Lathes with the following specifications may have this issue: Machines with Old MOCON (Parameter 2100 = 0/FALSE) Press Diagnostic and navigate to the System tab. The MOCON version will be in the Software section. MOCON Version 1.16 or 1.16 .K is the Old MOCON Version. 24 Pocket BMT65 turret option. Software version 100.22.000.1020 to 100.22.000.2000.|Workaround #1: Machines with Old MOCON and 24 Pocket BMT65 turrets should not upgrade to software version 100.22.000.1020 to 100.22.000.2000. If the machine has been upgraded, downgrade to Software Version 100.22.000.1016. An Option 5 Software Update must be performed to downgrade software. Workaround #2: A patch can be applied to the machine that disables the half station pockets. Contact Haas Service to have the patch applied. Workaround #3: A new Software Version will be released that fixes this issue in a few weeks. All machines should upgrade to this software version once released.
