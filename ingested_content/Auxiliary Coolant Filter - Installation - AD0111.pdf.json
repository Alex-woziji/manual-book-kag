    "1": "# 2.1 AUXILIARY COOLANT FILTER - INSTALLATION\n\nLAST UPDATED: 03/03/2023\n\n# Auxiliary Coolant Filter - Installation\n\nAD0111\n\nApplies to machines built from: January, 1998\n\n# Auxiliary Coolant Filter - Installation Video\n\nThe following service video shows how to\nconnect the auxiliary coolant filter to the\nfollowing coolant systems:\n\nStandard coolant pump\nHigh pressure coolant (HPC)/ThroughSpindle Coolant (TSC) 300 pump\nHPC/TSC 300/1K with an Auto-Clean\npump\n\n###  Note: This service video is for reference\n\nonly and does not replace the written\nprocedure.\n\n###  Note: This option is not compatible with\n\nthe Multistage Coolant Pump.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis procedure tells you how to install an\nauxiliary coolant filter (AF) system. This #2\nbag-type filter system removes contamination\nand small particles from the coolant before\nthey go through the coolant pump again.\n\nThis procedure tells you how to connect the\nAF to these coolant systems:\n\nStandard coolant pump [1]\nHigh pressure coolant (HPC)/ThroughSpindle Coolant (TSC) 300 pump [2]\nHPC/TSC 300/1K with an Auto-Clean\npump [3]\n\n### Note: Machines built after 2014 have a\n\nHPC/TSC-300 Pump with a Auto Clean\nfeature. These pumps use an airline to clean\nthe filter during a tool change.\n\nMachine Compatibility:\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/auxiliary-coolant-filter---installation-ad0111.html 2/4\n\n\n![](photo/Auxiliary Coolant Filter - Installation - AD0111.pdf/Auxiliary-Coolant-Filter---Installation---AD0111.pdf-1-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "2": "# Standard Coolant Pump - Installation\n\nIf the machine has a standard coolant pump:\n\nDisconnect the coolant supply hose [1],\nfrom the pump outlet [2].\nConnect the lower supply hose [3] to\nthe coolant supply hose [1].\nConnect the upper AF hose [4] to the\ncoolant pump outlet [2].\nClose the machine doors and windows.\n\n###  Note: Coolant can splash in the machine.\n\nStart the coolant pump.\nWhile the coolant pump is on, open the\nAF lid.\n\n###  Note: This pushes the air out of the AF.\n\nClose the lid when the AF is full.\n\n# HPC/TSC-300 Without Auto Clean - Installation\n\nHPC/TSC 300 pump without the Auto\nClean pump.\n\nRemove the coolant return loop [1].\nInstall the coolant hose adapter [A] to\nthe 3/4\" NPT port.\nConnect the upper AF hose [2] to the\ncoolant hose adapter.\nConnect the 12\" (30 cm) pump hose [B]\nto the 1/2\" NPT port in the pump\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/auxiliary-coolant-filter---installation-ad0111.html 3/4\n\n\n![](photo/Auxiliary Coolant Filter - Installation - AD0111.pdf/Auxiliary-Coolant-Filter---Installation---AD0111.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
