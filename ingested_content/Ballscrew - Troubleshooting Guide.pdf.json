Nut Housing to axis in question Bolts (Saddle, Table, Spindle Head, Etc.)\n2. Ballscrew to Nut Housing Bolts\n3. Bearing support Bolts\n\nJog the Axis back and forth several times, then stop the axis at the bearing support and torque all bolts\nthat were loosened\nJog the Axis through its entire travel observing for consistent servo load\n\n# Lubrication\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMake sure there is a light coat of oil or grease on the surface of\nthe ballscrew. If there is not, inspect the entire lubrication\nsystem for leaks and clogs, including all tubes, hoses, and\nfittings. Check for leaks on each axis: A leak at one axis will\ncause a lack of lubrication at a different axis. Check for oil or\ngrease puddles to help locate the source of the leak.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/Ballscrew_Troubleshooting_Guide.html 4/7\n\n\n![](photo/Ballscrew - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Ballscrew---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "4": "###  Note: The Haas Liquid Grease lubrication system uses\n\nadapter fittings [2] in the axis manifolds [1]. The linear guide\ntrucks and ballnuts use restrictor fittings [3]. The restrictor\nfitting has a gap [5] between the threads and the set screw [4].\nThis forces the manifold-fed grease to pass through the gap [4]\nto lubricate the axes.\n\n[Make sure the correct lubrication is used. Refer to LUBRICANT,](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/reference-documents/lubricant--grease--and-sealant-tables-for-haas-machine-component.html)\n[GREASE, AND SEALANT TABLES FOR HAAS MACHINE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/reference-documents/lubricant--grease--and-sealant-tables-for-haas-machine-component.html)\n[COMPONENTS.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/reference-documents/lubricant--grease--and-sealant-tables-for-haas-machine-component.html)\n\n\n# Ballscrew/Ballnut or Support Bearing\n\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nDisconnect the lubrication fitting [1] from the ballnut [2].\nRemove the screws [3] that attach the ballnut [2] to the ballnut\nhousing [4].\n\nBallscrew/Ballnut\n\nSeparate the ballnut [2] from the ballnut housing [4]. Rotate the\nballnut [2] by hand and hold the ballscrew [5] so it does not\nrotate, and the ballnut [2] will move away from the ballnut\nhousing [4].\n\nThe ballnut [2] should rotate smoothly. If there is resistance or\nif it binds, the ballscrew [5] and ballnut [2] are faulty.\n\nSupport Bearing\n\nRotate the ballscrew [5] by hand. If there is resistance or if it\nbinds, the bearings are faulty. Remove the ballscrew [5] and\ncheck the support bearings and bearing pack to determine\nwhich components need to be replaced.\n\n\n![](photo/Ballscrew - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Ballscrew---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-1.png)\n\n# Coupler\n\nCorrective Action:\n\n[Refer to the BALLSCREW BACKLASH TEST PROCEDURE that is](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/vmc---ballscrew---backlash-test.html)\nappropriate for your machine.\n\nPower off and lock out the machine. Remove the necessary\ncovers to access the axis with the problem. Remove the axis\nmotor cover.\n\nInstall the coupler-installation tool [1] on the motor coupling.\nTurn the ballscrew so you can see the screw [4] for the motorcoupling clamp.\n\nRemove the motor screws [2]. Loosen the screw [4] on the\nmotor-coupling clamp. Remove the motor with the motorcoupling assembly. Remove the ballscrew key [3]. Inspect for\ndamage or wear on the key or keyway.\n\n###  Note: If the axis motor is disconnected from the ballscrew,\n\nthe grid offset and the work offset (such as G54) must be reset.\n[Go to AXIS SERVO MOTOR - SET GRID OFFSET PARAMETER.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/axis-servo-motor---set-grid-offset-parameter.html)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/Ballscrew_Troubleshooting_Guide.html 5/7\n\n\n![](photo/Ballscrew - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Ballscrew---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "5": "Make sure the flex pack [5] in the coupler is not damaged. It\nshould be straight, and tightly compressed together.\n\n###  Note: If the axis motor is disconnected from the ballscrew,\n\nthe grid offset and the work offset (such as G54) must be reset.\n[Go to AXIS SERVO MOTOR - SET GRID OFFSET PARAMETER.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/axis-servo-motor---set-grid-offset-parameter.html)\n\n\n![](photo/Ballscrew - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Ballscrew---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-5-1.png)\n\nCOUPLER ALIGNMENT:\n\nTo realign the coupler to the motor shaft install the mounting\nbolts loosely and float the motor in until the coupling slides\nfrom between both the motor shaft and ballscrew shaft easily.\n\nTorque the bolts down and verify the coupler still slides easily\nbetween the two shafts.\n\nTorque the coupler pinch bolt to the specifications found on\n__________.\n\n\n# Thermal Growth\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nYou must warm up the machine axes to bring the ballscrews to a normal temperature for operation. You can\nwarm up the machine automatically by changing certain settings: Use either Settings 158-160 or\nSettings 109-112. Do not use both.\n\nSettings 158-160: These settings can be set from -30 to +30 and will adjust the screw thermal\ncompensation by -30% to +30%.\nSettings 109-112: This (Setting 109) is the number of minutes (up to 300 minutes from power-up)\nduring which the compensations specified in Settings 110-112 are applied.\n\n###  IMPORTANT: If your application involves moving a single axis repeatedly back and forth over a small area\n\nof the ballscrew, the ballnut will heat up the ballscrew and cause thermal expansion. It will also not lubricate\ncorrectly because of the short stroke. Every few minutes, it is necessary to move 80% to 90% of the axis travel\nin order to cycle the grease throughout the ballnut. This is common on smaller machines with a smaller work\nenvelope.\n\nFor lathes: Go to the DIAGNOSTICS screen. Check the X Axis Temp. If the measurement fluctuates or has no\nvalue, you must inspect the thermal sensor on the ballnut.\n\n# Linear Scale Compensation (LSC)\n\nThis section applies to Machines with Dual Ballscrews.\n\nOpen the LSC.LSCX file found in the Error\nreport in a spreadsheet program. Determine\nif axis compensation has been applied by\nlooking at the correction column.\n\nA value of 1.7977E+308 [1] or zero in\nthe correction column\nmeans that there is no compensation.\nAny other value [2] in the correction\ncolumn means there is compensation.\n\n###  Note: Compensation values will vary\nbetween machines.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/Ballscrew_Troubleshooting_Guide.html 6/7\n\n\n![](photo/Ballscrew - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Ballscrew---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-5-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
