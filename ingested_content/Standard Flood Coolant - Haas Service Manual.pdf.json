The videos are based on decades of day-to-day experience in our\nown factory machine shop, in our service department, and at our Haas Factory Outlets around\nthe world.\n\nEach video covers a complete topic, so you can watch them in any order, all together, or\nindividually. If you are new to mixing and maintaining coolant, we recommend that you start\nwith “Tools of Coolant”. This video gives you a complete overview of the tools you will need to\nmake your coolant maintenance easier.\n\n####  Note: Be sure to maintain your coolant mixture to keep the coolant concentrate at\n\nacceptable levels. Improperly maintained coolant mixtures can allow machine components to\nrust. Rust damage is not covered by your warranty. Always wear proper eye protection when\nmaintaining coolant systems.
