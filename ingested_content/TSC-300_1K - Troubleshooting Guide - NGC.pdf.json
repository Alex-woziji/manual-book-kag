Always use a soluble\noil or a semi-synthetic coolant, mixed to the manufacturer’s recommended concentration. Full synthetic\ncoolants typically do not have adequate lubricity and don’t always have adequate rust preventative properties.\n\nGood system performance and reliability also relies on adequate coolant filtration. If you are cutting cast\nmaterials or abrasive materials you need to use the Haas Auxiliary Filter assembly.\n\n# Symptom Table\n\nSYMPTOM POSSIBLE CAUSE(S) CORRECTIVE ACTION(S)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/tsc-300-1k---troubleshooting-guide---ngc.html 3/15\n\n|SYMPTOM|POSSIBLE CAUSE(S)|CORRECTIVE ACTION(S)|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n",
