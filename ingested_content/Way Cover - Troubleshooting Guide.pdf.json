    "1": "LAST UPDATED: 03/08/2022\n\n\n# Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide\n\n Introduction\n\nWay covers keep chips and coolant away from the ballscrew, guiderails, and home switch. Machines can have\nthree types of way covers.\n\n\n1. Telescopic Style: Telescopic way\n\ncovers use interlocking sheet metal\nsections with wipers at the joints.\n2. Shielded Style: Shielded way covers\n\nuse rubber straps to connect sheet\nmetal shield strips that overlaying each\nother.\n3. Roll Shade Style - EC Machines: Roll\n\nshade way covers use a tensioner to\nkeep the rubber sheet rolled up on a\nspool. The spools rotate with tension\nto allow the sheet to be pulled out and\nretracted back in.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-1-0.png)\n\n# Symptom Table\n\nSYMPTOM POSSIBLE CAUSE CORRECTIVE ACTION\n\nNormal wear on wipers.

Go to PARTS.HAASCNC.COM.](http://parts.haascnc.com/)\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-1.png)\n\nSymptom: The way covers are damaged or\nworn.\n\nPossible Cause: A part or other heavy object\nfell on the way cover. Cutting abrasive or\nabsorbant materials. The way covers are not\nlubricated correctly. Chip build-up around the\nbase of roll shade way covers.\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nRemove the way cover and hammer out the\ndents with a rubber mallet. Replace the way\ncover if the dents are too severe. Go\n[to DIY.HAASCNC.COM, and search for the way](http://diy.haascnc.com/)\ncover replacement procedure that is correct\nfor your machine.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\nCutting abrasive materials: Haas machines\nare designed and built to cut metal. If you cut\nabrasive or absorbant material, it causes\npremature wear of the way covers. This is not\ncovered under warranty. Install aftermarket\nbellows that wrap around the way covers to\nprotect them from abrasive material.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/waycover-troubleshooting-guide.html 3/5\n\n\n-----\n\n",
    "3": "The shielded way cover sections are\nseparated: There is a rubber link between\nthe shielded way cover sections. If one of\nthese links is broken, the shielded way cover\nsections separate. Replace way covers that\nhave broken rubber links.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\nRoll Shade Way Covers - EC machines: Both\nsides of the spindle are covered by heavy roll\nshade way covers [1,2]. The shades are kept\ntaut by spring-loaded canisters [3, 4]. Chip\nbuild up around the bottom of the spring\nloaded canisters causes insufficient tension on\nthe roll shade way covers. This causes the\ncomponents to be contaminated by coolant.\n\nRemove the chips on and around the shades.\n\nTo re-tension the way covers:\n\nClamp the flat section of the steel shaft [8]\nwith clamping pliers or a clamp. This holds the\nshaft when you adjust the spring tension.\nLoosen the set screw [7]. The shaft rotates\nwhen the set screw is loose. Rotate the shaft\none complete revolution against the force of\nthe spring.\n\n###  Note: Rotate the shaft counter clockwise\n\n[5] for the left canister [3] and clockwise [6] for\nthe right canister [4].\n\nTighten the set screw. Make sure the set\nscrew [7] is seated on the flat section of the\nsteel shaft. Check the tension of the roll shade\nway covers. Repeat this process as needed\none revolution at a time. Do not over-tighten\nthe spring.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n# Way Covers \"Pop\" or Do Not Move Evenly\n\nSymptom: Way covers \"pop,\" or do not move evenly.\n\nPossible Cause: Normal operation.\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nTight way covers can sometimes make a \"popping\" noise when they move. This is normal, and does not\nrequire troubleshooting.\n\nIf there is an excessive amount of noise from friction, go to Section 4 to troubleshoot the \"excessive noise\"\nsymptom.\n\n# Way Cover has Trouble Extending or Retracting\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/waycover-troubleshooting-guide.html 4/5\n\n\n-----\n\n",
    "4": "Symptom: Way cover has trouble\nextendening or retracting. Way cover sections\nmay pop apart.\n\nPossible Cause: Way cover is full of chips.\n\nCorrective Action: Perform normal machine\nmaintenance.\n\nRemove way cover and clean out the chips.\nRe-assemble way cover once clean if\nnecessary. Re-install way cover when finished.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n# The Way Covers are Rusty or make Excessive Noise\n\n\nSymptom: The way covers are rusty or make\nexcessive noise.\n\nPossible Cause: The coolant concentration is\nlow. Way cover movement during dry machine\noperation creates friction. The rail bolts are\nloose.\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nWhen the machine operates normally, way\ncovers are lubricated by the coolant. It is\ncritical to maintain the correct coolant\nconcentration. For instructions, refer to the\n[link for STANDARD COOLANT – MAINTAINING](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/video/coolantseries.html)\n[YOUR COOLANT MIXTURE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/video/coolantseries.html)\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\nDry machining: If you cut parts without flood\ncoolant, make sure that you lubricate all of the\nway covers with lightweight oil. Fully extend\nthe way cover. Spray an even coat of\nlightweight oil on the way cover.\n\nThe way covers slide on the rails that are\nattached to the casting. If you lubricate the\nway cover on the outside, and it still makes\nnoise, apply grease to the rails.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\nThe way cover rails are loose: Tighten\nloose rail bolts.\n\nIf the bolts [1] that hold the way cover rails to\nthe casting are loose, the way covers make\n\"popping\" noises when they move. This\neventually damages the plastic tabs [2] that\nslide on the rails. This causes sections of the\nway cover to separate and to leak coolant.\n\nAs soon as the way covers start to make\n\"popping\" noises, inspect the rails for loose\nscrews. Tighten the loose screws to prevent\ndamage to the tabs.\n\n\n![](photo/Way Cover - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Way-Cover---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/waycover-troubleshooting-guide.html 5/5\n\n\n-----\n\n"
