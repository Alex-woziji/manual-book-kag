Error increases as gripper moves down the table that can cause the gripper to crash into parts.|Flat style rail guides allow the table to drift and change the pickup/dropoff locations.|Upgrade the table to the new linear guide rails. The Part Number is 93-3163. Follow the Installation Guide to upgrade your table.|\n|Machine generates Alarm 9920 POSITION ERROR TOO LARGE or 9921 VELOCITY ERROR TOO LARGE during zero return or handle jog.|The machine configuration files may be incorrect.|Contact the service department for more information.|\n||The rollers are misaligned.|Loosen and realign the rollers on the specified axis.|\n|There is a loud noise when the AV Axis is jogged or is in motion.|A faulty AV- axis motor can generate noise.|Remove the AV axis motor from the module and run the motor by itself and see if the noise repeats. If the noise repeats the problem is with the motor.|\n||The module is not aligned.|Loosen the screws from the module and jog the AV axis to its full travel a few times. This will help self aling the module to the base, tighten the screws when done.|\n|The APL skips the unload sequence of a finished part.|There is a workholding state commanded in the part program.|Remove the workholding command from the part program. Workholding states are commanded in the APL template.|\n|There is a delay when the grippers are commanded to rotate or clamp/unclamp.|There is a small delay when the digital SMC solenoid is commanded.|Order service kits 93-3450 & 93- 3452 and follow the Low Load Solenoid Valve Kit - Installation procedure.|\n|The Light Curtain when broken does not trigger the machine to stop APL motion.|There is no input from the light curtian to the machine.|See the Light Curtain Troubleshooting Guide for more information.|\n|When trying to run the machine a yellow warning message appears saying \"Please activate Light Curtain or Cell Safe\".|The correct safety parameter kit has not been applied to the machine.|Order the corresponding Front Automation Safety or Side Automation Safety kits (93- 1000997 or 93-1000996) and re- upload the configuration files from HBC.|\n\n\n![](photo/APL - Troubleshooting - Haas Service Manual.pdf/APL---Troubleshooting---Haas-Service-Manual.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n###### https://www.haascnc.com/service/online-manuals/haas-automatic-parts-loader---user-manual/troubleshooting.html 3/8\n\n\n-----\n\n",

Only active nodes should be enabled.|\n||The CAN PCB does not have power.|Verify that the Low Volt Power supply is supplying power to the CAN PCB.|\n||The CAN node Communication cable is disconnected.|Power down machine for at least a minute. Verify all CAN communication cables are connected correctly.|\n||The CAN Module ID Selector is incorrect.|Power down machine for at least a minute. Set ID selector correctly. Power up machine.|\n||The CAN Modules have incorrect termination.|Power down machine for at least a minute. Verify that only last node in the chain is terminated. Power up machine.|\n||The CAN Node needs to be reset.|Disable CAN Node via 9000.001 -> 9031.001. If the machine recovers (I/O page isn’t “X”) after disabling a particular node, try to enable the node again.|\n|Alarm 9798: IOPCB CAN FCT CRC MISMATCH|A test of the internal CRC for the Factory Config Table (FCT) located on one of the CAN devices does not match the CRC for the machines FCT. This can happen due to power failure at a critical time or after replacement of a CAN board attached to the I/O board|1. Press [POWER OFF]. 2. Put the USB memory device into the control. Note: The USB memory device must contain your Haas Control Key and the correct configuration files. 3. Press [POWER ON]. 4. Press [DIAGNOSTIC]. 5. Go to I/O Config in the Diagnostics tab. 6. Press [F3] to Update Config Table. 7. Press [RESET] to continue. If the alarm does not clear, cycle the machine power.
