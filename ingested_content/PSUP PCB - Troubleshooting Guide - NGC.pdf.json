This decreases the risk of injury and mechanical damage.\n\nSet the main circuit breaker to the [OFF] position.\n\n###  Danger: Before beginning any work inside the control cabinet the High Voltage indicator light on the 320V\n\nPower Supply / Vector Drive must have been off for at least 5 minutes.\n\nSome service procedures can be dangerous or life-threatening. DO NOT attempt a procedure that you do not\nfully understand. If you have any doubts about doing a procedure contact your Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) and\nschedule a service visit.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---power-distribution-pcb-and-pfdm---trou.html 2/8\n\n\n-----\n\n",
