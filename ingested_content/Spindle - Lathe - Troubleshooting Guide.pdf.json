    "1": "# 4.2 LATHE SPINDLE - TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nLAST UPDATED: 07/16/2024\n\n# Spindle - Lathe - Troubleshooting Guide\n\n Lathe Spindle Inspection Report\n\n###  Download and fillout the lathe spindle Inspection Report Checklist below before\n\nreplacing any parts.\n\n#### SPINDLE - LATHE - SERVICE CHECKLIST\n\n# Section 1: Introduction\n\n###  NOTE: Although this troubleshooting\n\nguide is for the main spindle many of the\nsypmtoms in the symptoms table can be\nused for the sub spindle.\n\nThe most common problems with a lathe\nspindle are vibration, noise and surface finish.\n\nVibration is caused by runout. Look first at\nyour workholding and your material. Ensure\nthe chuck body or collet nose runs true; that\nyour jaws are bored correctly; that your\nmaterial isn’t running out. If you are bar\nfeeding make sure the liner fits the material\nproperly. If you still have a problem check\nrunout of the hydraulic closer, the brake disc\nand all adapters.\n\nIf you haven’t fixed noise by addressing\nvibration above then the most likely cause is\nthe drive belt. Make sure tension is correct;\nthat the belt is in good condition; that shaft\nalignment is good and the belt isn’t forced\nagainst a pulley flange.\n\nIf you have a surface finish problem that\nhasn’t been solved by the above then check\nthe application: speeds, feeds, tool tip\nalignment, coolant flow, etc. also check\nmachine alignments.\n\nFor more lathe spindle symptoms please view\nthe troubleshooting table below. For\nreference, the spindle drivetrain consists of\nthe following:\n\n1. Chuck or Collet\n2. Drawtube\n3. Bearings\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/Lathe-Spindle-Troubleshooting-Guide.html 2/11\n\n\n![](photo/Spindle - Lathe - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Spindle---Lathe---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-1-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",

    "9": "# Section 7: Motor Encoder Feedback\n\nThe Haas spindle drive system is a Closed Loop System and requires continuous feedback from the encoder to\nprecisely control the spindle speed via the motor. Inadequate encoder feedback could cause vibration and\nnoise in the spindle drivetrain. Test the encoder feedback by turning the power to the machine off while\nrunning the spindle and let the spindle coast. If the vibration goes away when power is off, then troubleshoot\nthe Encoder / Encoder belt / Wye-Delta Contactor / or Vector Drive.\n\nIf the machine is equipped with the non-contact spindle encoder, then check the read head alignment\nwith the provided shim (incorrect read head alignment could cause unreliable feedback).\n\n[For Encoder troubleshooting information refer to the SPINDLE ENCODER - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/spindle-non-contact-encoder-nce--troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n[For Vector drive troubleshooting information refer to the VECTOR DRIVE - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/vector-drive---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n[For Belt troubleshooting information refer to the DRIVE BELTS - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/drive-belt-troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n# Section 8: Lathe Spindle Inertia Load Type Setting\n\nMachines that experience alarm 650 / Alarm 4.994 will need to do the follwing:\n\n1.
