If the oil is\ncontaminated with coolant, drain and replace\nthe oil (refer to the Coolant Contamination\nsection).\n\nMake sure the hoses are routed correctly [4]\nand are secure. Tie them together with zip ties\n\n[3]. Damage can occur to the hoses if they rub\n\n[1] against other components, have sharp\nbends, or are kinked [2]. Replace the hoses if\nthey are damaged.\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Power Unit - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Power-Unit---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/haas-hydraulic-power-unit---troubleshooting-guide.html 4/10\n\n\n-----\n\n",

Check the voltage to the solenoid.\n\n1. Pull the solenoid connectors partially\n\napart so you can access the leads with\nyour needle-tip probes while the\nsolenoid is connected.\n2. With the chuck or tailstock in\n\noperation, measure the voltage to the\nsolenoid. The measured voltage must\nbe 120 VAC.\n\nIf there is no voltage, refer to these\ntroubleshooting guides:\n\n[NGC - I/O PCB - TROUBLESHOOTING](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[CHC - I/O PCB - TROUBLESHOOTING](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\nIf the solenoid receives voltage, but it does not\noperate correctly, clean the valve:\n\n1. Power off the machine.\n2. Remove the solenoid valve. Use\n\ncompressed air to clean the solenoid\nvalve.\n3. Reinstall the solenoid valve.\n4. Test for correct operation.\n\n###  Caution: Do not lose the (4) o-rings when\nyou reinstall the solenoid valve.\n\n# Settings\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMake sure Setting 216 SERVO AND HYDRAULIC SHUTOFF is set to (120) seconds or less. Do not have this\nsetting set to (0), the HPU will not turn off, and will create unwanted air bubbles and heat. This setting will\npower-down the HPU when the machine is idle. This helps dissipate the air bubbles in the oil.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/haas-hydraulic-power-unit---troubleshooting-guide.html 5/10\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Power Unit - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Power-Unit---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "5": "Machines with the Classic Haas Control with software version 11.27A or higher and all Next Generation\nControl machines do not allow you to set this setting to (0). The limits on this setting for these machines are 10\nseconds to 99 minutes.\n\n# Air Leaks/Pickup Tube\n\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nCheck for oil leaks at the intake pipe [1]. If\nthere are leaks, clean the threads on the\nintake pipe [1]. Reapply thread sealant, and\ninstall the intake pipe [1].\n\nIf the symptom persists, go to the Tank\nReconfiguration section to reconfigure the\npipes.\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Power Unit - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Power-Unit---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-5-0.png)\n\n# Oil Pressure\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nAlways make sure the oil level is correct and the filter is clean (refer to the Oil Level section and the Filter\nsection).\n\nPush [EMERGENCY STOP]. Wait half an hour while the air and oil separate. Resume machine operation. Check\nif the normal pressure returns while the operation resumes. If the symptom occurs again:\n\nReduce the hydraulic clamp pressure by about 25 PSI to reduce the rate of the hydraulic union leak at\nthe slip joint.\nReduce the cycle time with higher feed rates.\nReduce the spindle RPM.\n\n\n###  Caution: Do not add anti-foaming agents. These agents are already present in the HPU oil.\n\n  Note: If low pressure alarms are generated or the hydraulic pressure gauge comes up to pressure very\n\nslowly, it can be due to cold oil and/or a lower pressure setting. There is a long set screw snubber in the\nmanifold behind the gauge and a 10 micron sintered bronze snubber in the gauge. These components protect\ngauges from failing during large pressure changes and slow the pressure gauge’s response to pressure\nchanges or coming up to pressure from idle. These usually happen when the tailstock is reversing direction.\nThese pressure changes are happening quicker at the chuck or tailstock then at the gauge or gauge page. The\nhigher the pressure and warmer the oil, the faster the gauges will respond to pressure changes.\n\nMAXIMUM CHUCK OPERATING PRESSURES\n\nType psi Bar\n\n5\" Chuck 330 23\n\n6\" Chuck 330 23\n\n8\" Chuck, 2\" Bore 330 23\n\n8\" Chuck, 2.5\" Bore 260 18\n\n10\" Chuck 330 23\n\n12\" Chuck, 3\" Bore 400 28\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/haas-hydraulic-power-unit---troubleshooting-guide.html 6/10\n\n|MAXIMUM CHUCK OPERATING PRESSURES|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Type|psi|Bar|\n|5\" Chuck|330|23|\n|6\" Chuck|330|23|\n|8\" Chuck, 2\" Bore|330|23|\n|8\" Chuck, 2.5\" Bore|260|18|\n|10\" Chuck|330|23|\n|12\" Chuck, 3\" Bore|400|28|\n\n\n-----\n\n",

Some machines have\nremotely-mounted heat exchangers with\nintegral fans.\n\nThe spindle fan on machines with the Classic\nHaas Control with software version 11.27A or\nhigher and all Next Generation Control\nmachines must stay on when the HPU is on.\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Power Unit - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Power-Unit---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-6-0.png)\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nClean or replace the pressure filter [1] on the\npump assembly.
