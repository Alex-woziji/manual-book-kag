A bi-directional solenoid\nsupplies fluid for forwards and backwards movements. Normal movement of the tail stock uses metered\npressure set with the adjustment knob on the side of the HPU block. A gauge is supplied to accurately adjust\ntail stock pressure.\n\nWhen a rapid motion is desired, a Rapid motion soleniod supplies full HPU pressure to the directional\nsolenoid.\n\nThe Tail Stock uses a string encoder for positioning purposes. To establish home position, the tailstock\nretracts until it bottoms out the hydraulic actuator. When the rearward motion is stopped, the machine\n[control assigns this the home position. Reference this video HOW THE TAIL STOCK FINDS HOME for more](https://haascnc-1.wistia.com/medias/oszuzb7ret)\ninformation\n\n# Symptom Table\n\nSYMPTOM CORRECTIVE ACTION\n\nTailstock Advance button or\n\nUse M21 or the foot pedal to maintain\n\nhandle jog, used to put\n\npressure on the part.\n\npressure on the part.\n\nPart chatter.\n\nSpindle Speed Variation not in\nUse SSV to control part chatter.\nuse.\n\nTailstock is out of alignment.

Pressure\napplied by the TS hand jog keys is not always\nconsistent, and can result in chatter marks on\nthe part.\n\nAlways use M21 or the foot pedal to maintain\npressure on the part.\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Tailstock - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Tailstock---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-1.png)\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nSpindle Speed Variation (SSV) allows you to\nspecify a range within which the spindle speed\nwill continuously change.\n\nThis changes the frequency of the machining\nprocess, which helps to suppress chatter.\n\nM38 turns SSV mode ON and M39 turns\nit OFF.\n\nSetting 165 specifies the amount that the\nspindle speed changes above and below the\nprogrammed speed.\n\nSetting 166 specifies the SSV duty cycle in\n0.1-second increments. The duty cycle affects\nthe rate of spindle speed change.\n\n\n![](photo/Hydraulic Tailstock - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Hydraulic-Tailstock---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/hydraulic-tailstock-troubleshooting-guide.html 3/6\n\n\n-----\n\n",

Damage can occur\nby the comb strip rubbing on the optical\nsensor.

Carefully pull the\nstring out and let it retract slowly.\n\nMake sure the string [1] can move freely in\nand out of the encoder housing. Make sure\nthe encoder string is not pinched or touching\nthe way cover at anytime during its travel. The\nB-Axis position on the screen should change\nas you pull on the encoder string.
