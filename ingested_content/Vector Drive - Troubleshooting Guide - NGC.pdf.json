There are three sizes of Haas\nVector drives: 20HP [1], 40HP [2] and 60HP [3].\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-1-0.png)\n\n# Spindle Drive Components Overview Video\n\n Electrical Safety\n\n\nThis service video shows a quick illustration of\nhow the Haas Control functions during a\nspindle command.\n\n###  Note: This service video is for reference\n\nonly and does not replace the written\ntroubleshooting information.\n\n\n###  Caution: When you do maintenance or repair on CNC machines and their components, you must always\n\nfollow basic safety precautions. This decreases the risk of injury and mechanical damage.\n\nSet the main circuit breaker to the [OFF] position.\n\n###  Danger: Before beginning any work inside the control cabinet the High Voltage indicator light on the 320V\n\nPower Supply / Vector Drive must have been off for at least 5 minutes.\n\nSome service procedures can be dangerous or life-threatening. DO NOT attempt a procedure that you do not\nfully understand. If you have any doubts about doing a procedure contact your Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) and\nschedule a service visit.\n\n# Vector Drive Troubleshooting Video\n\n Symptom Table\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/vector-drive---troubleshooting-guide.html 2/8\n\n\n-----\n\n",

    "4": "Inspect the vector drive. Disconnect all the vector drive terminals and do the following tests:\n\nSet your meter to Ohms test mode.\n\nPut the black lead on chassis with the\nred lead measure terminals 4 (A), 5 (B)\nand 6 (C).\n\nIf the meter does not show OPEN (O.L) the\nvector drive is damaged.\n\nSet your meter to Ohms test mode.\n\nPut the black lead on terminal 2 (+)\nwith the red lead measure the motor\noutput terminals 9 (A), 10 (B) and 11\n(C).\n\nThe meter should show high resistance\nreadings typically in the Kilo or Mega ohms. If\nthe meter reads very low resistance the Vector\ndrive is damaged.\n\nSet your meter to Ohms test mode.\n\nPut the black lead on terminal 3 (-) with\nthe red lead measure the motor output\nterminals 9 (A), 10 (B) and 11 (C).\n\nThe meter should show high resistance\nreadings typically in the Kilo or Mega ohms. If\nthe meter reads very low resistance the Vector\nDrive is damaged.\n\nSet your meter to Ohms test mode.\n\nPut the black lead on terminal 3 (-) with\nthe red lead measure terminal 1 (R).\n\nIf your meter reads less than100k ohms, the\nvector drive is damaged.\n\n# Regen Load\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nPress [POWER OFF]. If the vector drive voltage\nindicator light is on, do not touch the electrical\ncomponents. The high voltage in the control\ncabinet can kill you. Wait for the voltage\nindicator LED on the vector drive to go off\ncompletely.\n\nDisconnect the REGEN load leads from the\nvector drive at terminals 1 and 2. Measure the\nresistance across the leads. The reading must\nbe as follows:\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/vector-drive---troubleshooting-guide.html 5/8\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-4-1.png)\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-4-2.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "5": "![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-5-3.png)\n\n# DC BUSS\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nPress [POWER ON]. Measure the DC voltage\nbetween terminals 2 and 3 on the vector\ndrive. Compare the measured voltage with the\nDC VOLTAGE on the diagnostics page on the\ncontrol. The readings must match +-2%.\n\nIf the readings do not match, the problem can\nbe:\n\nA bad connection on the 640C cable.\nMake sure there is a tight connection\non the J3 connector on the Vector Drive\nand the P17 connector on the\nMaincon/Mocon.\nA faulty Vector Drive if you have\nincorrect voltage at P17.\nA faulty Maincon/Mocon if you have\nthe correct voltage on the 640C cable\nat the P17 connector of the\nMaincon/Mocon. There is 0.01 VDC for\nevery 1 VDC Bus. For example, 320 VDC\nmust show 3.2VDC.\n\nDisconnect the DC Bus cables from terminals\n2 and 3 on the vector drive. Power on the\nmachine. Monitor the DC VOLTAGE on the\ndiagnostics page of the control.\n\nIf the DC Bus goes back to the nominal\nvalue, there is a short in one of the\nservo amplifiers. A low resistance or a\nshort is a sign of a faulty servo\namplifier.\nIf the readings match and the alarm\ncontinues, the problem is a faulty\nvector drive.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/vector-drive---troubleshooting-guide.html 6/8\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-5-0.png)\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-5-1.png)\n\n-----\n\n",

The\ncooling fan must turn ON when the heat-sink\ntemperature reaches 50°C. The cooling fan\nmust turn OFF as the heat-sink cools down.\n\nMeasure the temperature of the vector drive's\nheat-sink through the exhaust vents when this\nalarm occurs. If the temperature is above 60°C\nand the fan is not ON, the vector drive has a\nfaulty cooling fan. Replace the cooling fan.\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-6-0.png)\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMeasure the AC voltage between all three pair\nphases at the main circuit breaker. The AC\nvoltage must be between 195 and 260 volts\n(360 and 480 volts for high voltage\noption).\n\nThe input voltage cables labeled 74, 75, and\n76 must be moved to the terminal block triple\nwhich corresponds to the average voltage\nmeasured.\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-6-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/vector-drive---troubleshooting-guide.html 7/8\n\n\n![](photo/Vector Drive - Troubleshooting Guide - NGC.pdf/Vector-Drive---Troubleshooting-Guide---NGC.pdf-6-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
