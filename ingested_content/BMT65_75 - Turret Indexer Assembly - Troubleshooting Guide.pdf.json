For Haas machine air\npressure specifications, go to New Machine Pre-Installation for your machine model. Select your machine and\nscroll to the the section labeled \"Air/Coolant Requirements.\"\n\nAttempt a tool change on the machine. When the machine has the correct air pressure and flow, the needle on\nthe air pressure gauge should not drop more than 10 PSI (0.70 bar) during a tool change. This test confirms\nthat the air pressure and air flow into the machine are correct.\n\n# Clamp/Unclamp Proximity Sensor\n\nNavigate to the Diagnostic screen on the\npendant. Go to the I/O tab. Use an M43\n(Unclamp) M44 (Clamp) code in MDI mode to\ntroubleshoot the clamp/unclamp switch.\n\nCheck that Input 4 Tool Turret Locked and\nInput 7 Tool Turret Unlocked change states\nwhen the turret is commanded to\nunclamp/clamp.\n\nTest the sensor by placing a screwdriver in\nfront of the sensor. Make sure the inputs\nchange states.\n\nIf the input does not change, jump the cable\nconnector on the turret connector bracket. If\nthe input changes, replace the sensor.\n\nIf the input does not change, refer to:\n\n[PROXIMITY SENSOR - HOW IT WORKS](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/proximity-sensor---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[AND TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/proximity-sensor---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[NEXT GENERATION CONTROL - I/O PCB](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n[- TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/bmt-65-75---turret-indexer-assembly---troubleshooting-guide.html 3/5\n\n\n![](photo/BMT65_75 - Turret Indexer Assembly - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/BMT65_75---Turret-Indexer-Assembly---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
    "3": "# Servo Motor\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nDisconnect the axis servo motor cables. Make sure they are not contaminated. Measure the resistance from\nthe pins labeled A, B, and C at the motor power cable connector to chassis ground. The reading should show\nan open circuit. If there is resistance to ground, the cable is at fault.\n\n[Go to: AXIS SERVO MOTOR AND CABLES - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE to troubleshoot the SIGMA motor and](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/axis-servo-motor-and-cables---troubleshooting-guide---ngc.html)\nSIGMA motor cables.\n\n# Turret Pop Out\n\n\nIf you commanded an M43 (Unclamp) and the\nturret moved, but did not move far enough to\nclear the coupler, measure the distance the\nturret traveled.\n\nSet indicator to zero when turret unclamped\nM43. Command the turret to clamp M44. The\nindicator should measure 0.160\" - 0.200\".\n\nIf the turret does not travel far enough, the\npiston shaft, gears, or spring assembly could\nbe at fault, these components must be\ninspected by your local HFO.\n\n\n![](photo/BMT65_75 - Turret Indexer Assembly - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/BMT65_75---Turret-Indexer-Assembly---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n# Clamp / Unclamp Solenoid Voltage\n\n Internal Gears\n\n\nMeasure the voltage of the clamp/unclamp\nsolenoid. The solenoid is inside the\nConsolidated Air/Lubrication Manifold (CALM)\nCabinet.\n\nRun M43 (Unclamp) and M44 (Clamp) codes in\nMDI mode and measure the voltage of the\nsolenoids. The voltage must measure 120 VAC.\n\n[If there is no voltage, refer to the NEXT](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[GENERATION CONTROL - I/O PCB -](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n\n![](photo/BMT65_75 - Turret Indexer Assembly - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/BMT65_75---Turret-Indexer-Assembly---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\nThe turret's pop out and rotate function can\nfail because the tool changer gears are\ndamaged.

    "4": "# Spring Force\n\n## 1\n\nTo check the clamping force due to the\ninternal compression springs, measure the air\npressure required to overcome the springs\nand pop the turret out. Before supplying air to\nthe unclamp port, remove the purge air line\n\n[1] and replace it with a piece of hose clamped\nclosed [2] to avoid misreading the air\npressure.\n\n###  Note: Make sure to unplug the clamp hose\n\n[3] to remove any built up pressure in the\nsystem that would add to the clamping force.\n\n## 2\n\nPlug the airline to the incoming port [1] of the\npressure regulator and the outgoing port [2].\nConnect the airline from the outgoing port [2]\ninto the unclamping port of the indexer.\n\n###  Note: The unclamping port can be seen\n\nwith the red hose attached in the image\nabove.\n\n## 3\n\nSet up an indicator onto the turret to measure\npop out. Slowly increase the air pressure on\nthe regulator until you see a pop out of .001”\nfrom the indicator. Record this value of the air\npressure (PSI) required to overcome the\nclamping force of the springs.\n\nUse this value to calculate the spring clamp\nforce by multiplying it with the surface area of\nthe unclamping face of the piston (21.4in ). 2\n\nSpring Force = Applied Air (psi) * 21.4\nin^2\n\nThe spring force should fall between 509 - 730\nlbs.\n\n[If it does not, follow the BMT65/75 - TURRET -](https://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/bmt-turret-piston-replacment.html)\n[PISTON - REPLACEMENT procedure to replace](https://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/bmt-turret-piston-replacment.html)\nany damaged springs.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/bmt-65-75---turret-indexer-assembly---troubleshooting-guide.html 5/5\n\n\n![](photo/BMT65_75 - Turret Indexer Assembly - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/BMT65_75---Turret-Indexer-Assembly---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n![](photo/BMT65_75 - Turret Indexer Assembly - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/BMT65_75---Turret-Indexer-Assembly---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-4-1.png)\n\n-----\n\n"
