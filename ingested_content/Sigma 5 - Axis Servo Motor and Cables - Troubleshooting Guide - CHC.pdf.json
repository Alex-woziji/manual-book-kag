This decreases the risk of injury and mechanical damage.\n\nSet the main circuit breaker to the [OFF] position.\n\n###  Danger: Before beginning any work inside the control cabinet the High Voltage indicator light on the 320V\n\nPower Supply / Vector Drive must have been off for at least 5 minutes.\n\nSome service procedures can be dangerous or life-threatening. DO NOT attempt a procedure that you do not\nfully understand. If you have any doubts about doing a procedure contact your Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) and\nschedule a service visit.\n\n# Symptom Table\n\nSYMPTOM PROBABLE CAUSE CORRECTIVE ACTION\n\nEncoder signals are\n\nRefer to Serial Data Communication\n\naffected by noise from\n\nFaults / Electrical Noise section below.\n\nhigh power cables.\n\nInspect the cables and connectors.

If the\nserial data signal is missing or becomes\nunreliable the control will generate a serial\ndata communication error. Electrical noise can\ncause the serial data signal from the encoder\nto become unreliable and cause false alarms.\nFollow the troubleshooting guide below to\nhelp eliminate the noise in the system.\n\n1. Incorrect machine grounding. Make\n\nsure the ground wire size is correct.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/sigma-5---axis-servo-motor-and-cables---troubleshooting-guide.html 3/7\n\n\n![](photo/Sigma 5 - Axis Servo Motor and Cables - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC.pdf/Sigma-5---Axis-Servo-Motor-and-Cables---Troubleshooting-Guide---CHC.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",

Make sure it is not damaged.\n\nExamine the cable. Look for signs of damage\nor stiffness. The connector [4] has two\nhousings [2,3] for the cable pins.\n\nFaulty Encoder Corrective Action:\n\nCheck the encoder steps/revolution in the\nconfiguration file. Jog the axis and based on\nthe distance the ball screw travels per\nrevolution (ball screw pitch), verify the\nencoder counts are accurate per each\nrotation. View the diagnostic>axis page as you\njog the axis. The raw encoder count will show\nyou how many encoder steps have been\ncounted. The z axis channel will also show\nhow many steps have been counted, but will\nreset each time the z-pulse is passed. The zpulse is the encoder zero point, so it will reset\nevery time the encoder does one\nrevolution. Based on this information, you will\nknow if the encoder works if the correct\namount of steps per revolution are counted\neach time you jog the axis the distance of the\nball screw pitch length. If the numbers do not\nmatch up, you have a problem.\n\n\n![](photo/Sigma 5 - Axis Servo Motor and Cables - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC.pdf/Sigma-5---Axis-Servo-Motor-and-Cables---Troubleshooting-Guide---CHC.pdf-4-1.png)\n\nIf the pins have been pushed into the motor,\nyou must replace the motor and cable\ntogether.\n\nMake sure the cable is firmly connected at\nboth ends. Reseat both connections. Make\nsure the cable is installed in the correct\nconnector at the Maincon or MOCON PCB.\n\n\n![](photo/Sigma 5 - Axis Servo Motor and Cables - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC.pdf/Sigma-5---Axis-Servo-Motor-and-Cables---Troubleshooting-Guide---CHC.pdf-4-0.png)\n\nMake sure the cables are connected correctly to the corresponding amplifier. Inspect the connector at the\nmotor. Look for loose connections or contamination.\n\nLook for signs of damage or stiffness on the cable. Disconnect the power cable from the amplifier and motor.\nMeasure the resistance from leg to leg, and from leg to ground. Make sure the measurements result in an\nopen connection. Check each leg from one end of the cable to the corresponding leg on the other end of the\ncable for continuity. If there is an open connection, there is a problem with the cable.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/sigma-5---axis-servo-motor-and-cables---troubleshooting-guide.html 5/7\n\n\n-----\n\n",
