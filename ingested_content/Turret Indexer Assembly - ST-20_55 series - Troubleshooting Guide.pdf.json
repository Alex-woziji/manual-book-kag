    "2": "|Air leaking from solenoid muffler.|Air is bypassing the turret piston Quad-Ring.|Remove the non-pressureized air line, if the air is exhausting from the hose, the quad-ring has blowby. If the air is leaking from the solenoid then it has an internal leak.|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n# Incoming Air Supply\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMake sure that the air compressor supplies the correct air pressure and air flow. For Haas machine air\n[pressure specifications, go to NEW MACHINE PRE-INSTALLATION. Select your machine and scroll to the the](http://data.haascnc.com/install/)\nsection labeled \"Air/Coolant Requirements.\"\n\nAttempt a tool change on the machine. When the machine has the correct air pressure and flow, the needle on\nthe air pressure gauge should not drop more than 10 PSI (0.70 bar) during a tool change. This test confirms\nthat the air pressure and air flow into the machine are correct.\n\n# Clamp / Unclamp Proximity Sensors\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nGo to the Diagnostic screen on the pendant.\nGo to the I/O tab. Use an M43 (Unclamp) M44\n(Clamp) code in MDI mode to troubleshoot the\nswitch that generates the alarm.\n\nCheck the discrete input Tool Turret Unl. for\nAlarm 113, or T. Turret Locked for\nAlarm 114. Test the sensor: Hold a\nscrewdriver in front of the sensor. Make sure\nthe input changes. If the activation ring is in\nfront of the sensor, and you cannot test it,\nremove the sensor from the bracket to test\nthe sensor correctly.\n\nIf an input does not change, jump the cable\nconnector on the turret connector bracket.\n\nIf the input changes, replace the sensor.

Make sure they are not contaminated. Measure the resistance from\nthe pins labeled A, B, and C at the motor power cable connector to chassis ground. The reading should show\nan open circuit. If there is resistance to ground, the cable is at fault.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/st-20-25-30-35-y--ds-30-y-ss-ssy---turret-indexer-assembly---tro.html 3/5\n\n\n![](photo/Turret Indexer Assembly - ST-20_55 series - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Turret-Indexer-Assembly---ST-20_55-series---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",

The turret must move at least\n0.130\" for clearance past the couplers. The\nturret typically moves 0.200\".\n\nIf the turret does not travel far enough, the\npiston shaft, gears, or spring assembly could\nbe at fault, these components must be\ninspected by your local HFO.\n\n\n![](photo/Turret Indexer Assembly - ST-20_55 series - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Turret-Indexer-Assembly---ST-20_55-series---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n# Clamp / Unclamp Solenoid Voltage\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMeasure the voltage of the clamp and\nunclamp solenoids. The solenoids are inside\nthe consolidated air/lubrication manifold\n(CALM). The solenoids for Pre-CALM indexers\nare mounted on the turret housing.\n\nRun M43 (Unclamp) and M44 (Clamp) codes in\nMDI mode to measure the voltage of both the\nsolenoids. The voltage must measure 120 VAC.\n\nIf there is no voltage, refer to:\n\n[NEXT GENERATION CONTROL - I/O PCB](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n[- TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/next-generation-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[I/O PCB - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[(CLASSIC HAAS CONTROL)](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n# Internal Gears\n\nThe turret's pop out and rotate function can\nfail because the tool changer gears are\ndamaged. A machine crash can cause damage\nto the piston and gears, and must be\ninspected by your local HFO.\n\n# Quick Exhaust\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/st-20-25-30-35-y--ds-30-y-ss-ssy---turret-indexer-assembly---tro.html 4/5\n\n\n![](photo/Turret Indexer Assembly - ST-20_55 series - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Turret-Indexer-Assembly---ST-20_55-series---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
