Measure the noise with a DB meter at: the front of the machine when sliding doors open/closed and the back of the machine 3 ft away from the pump.|\n|---|---|---|\n||Low coolant levels.|Check coolant levels and refill as necessary.|\n||There is an alignment problem due to the pump not properly seated.|Loosen and re-tighten the standoffs supporting the pump. Refer to the Standoff Alignment section below for more information.|\n||Gear pump coupler misalignment.|Order kit 93-4195 Coolant Gear Pump Coupler Conversion Kit. Follow the Pump Head Coupling - Flexible Coupling Replacement procedure. If noise persists, replace pump head.|\n|Low coolant flow, the pump cavitates (cavitation sounds like heavy grit in the pump head, or a suction sound) or is otherwise noisy.|1st Generation Only: The pick-up hose can kink when the pump is running.|Replace the pick-up hose with the new version with a spring.|\n||Low coolant levels.|Check coolant levels and refill as necessary.|\n||Gear pump coupler misalignment.|Order kit 93-4195 Coolant Gear Pump Coupler Conversion.
