    "1": "LAST UPDATED: 01/31/2022\n\n\n# Servo Amplifier - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n Electrical Safety\n\n\nThere are four versions of Haas amplifiers.\n30A [1], 45A [2], 60A [3], and 90A [4]. All four\noperate the same way.\n\nSmart Amplifier assemblies are powered from\nthe 320 VDC Bus from the Vector Drive\nassembly or Minimill Power Supply. They each\nhave a red LED FAULT light, and a green LED\nPOWER ON light to show the status of the\namplifier.\n\n\n![](photo/Servo Amplifier - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC.pdf/Servo-Amplifier---Troubleshooting-Guide---CHC.pdf-1-0.png)\n\n###  Caution: When you do maintenance or repair on CNC machines and their components, you must always\n\nfollow basic safety precautions. This decreases the risk of injury and mechanical damage.\n\nSet the main circuit breaker to the [OFF] position.\n\n###  Danger: Before beginning any work inside the control cabinet the High Voltage indicator light on the 320V\n\nPower Supply / Vector Drive must have been off for at least 5 minutes.\n\nSome service procedures can be dangerous or life-threatening. DO NOT attempt a procedure that you do not\nfully understand. If you have any doubts about doing a procedure contact your Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) and\nschedule a service visit.\n\n# Symptom Table\n\nSymptom Possible Cause Corrective Action\n\nAlarms 161-164 AXIS DRIVE Amplifier detected a\n\nCheck cables for contamination or damage.\n\nFAULT short.\n\nAlarm 993 AMPLIFIER SHORT\nCIRCUIT Do the Amplifier Short Circuit\n\nInspection section.\n\nAlarm 2040 VECTOR DRIVE The amplifier has a Note: If a short-circuit is found, inspect the\n\ninternal short circuit. cable and motor for a short circuit before\n\nOR SPINDLE AMPLIFIER\ninstalling a new amplifier.\n\nSHORT CIRCUIT\n\nAlarms 161-164 AXIS DRIVE Check the command cable from the Maincon /\n\nAmplifier internal\n\nFAULT and Mocon PCB to amplifier.

Inspect the connectors pins. Test the axis on a different Maincon/Mocon channel, if the problem goes away there is a problem with the axis channel.|\n\n\n# Mechanical Blockage\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nMake sure the axis has a clear path of travel. Tools, part fixtures, or workpieces that are too large can crash\ninto the machine enclosure.\n\nLook at the machine's alarm history. Overload alarms followed by over current alarms are a sign of a crash.\n\nLook at the machine enclosure, spindle and tooling for damage. Damage to the tooling, fixtures and enclosure\nare signs of a crash.\n\nIf there are no signs of a crash, inspect the ballscrew and linear guides. They must move or turn freely by\nhand.\n\n# Amplifier Short Circuit Inspection\n\nCheck the amplifier for a short. Power off the machine. Disconnect the cables for the axis servo motor at the\namplifier that generates the alarm.\n\nPlace MultiMeter Leads Here Instructions\n\nSet the meter to ohms, and take the following readings:\n\nGround screw to RED, WHT, and BLK terminals\n\nIf the meter does not show open (o.l) the amplifier is damaged.\n\nSet the meter to Ohms, and take the following readings:\n\nBlack lead on HV (+) and Red lead to HV (-), RED, WHT, and BLK\nterminals.\n\nThe meter should show high resistance readings typically in the\nKilo or Mega ohms.

Contaminated or pinched cables\ncan cause a short. Replace the cables if\nnecessary.\n\nInspect the servo motor. Disconnect and\ninspect the power cable connector at the\nmotor. Make sure that there is no coolant\ncontamination. Coolant contamination can\ncause this alarm and damage the amplifier.\nMeasure the resistance from the pins labeled\nA, B and C at the motor connector to chassis\nground.\n\nThe reading should show an open\ncircuit.\nIf there is not open resistance, the\nservo motor is at fault.\n\n# Review the Part Program\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nThe machine load is too high. Decrease the feeds to decrease the machine load. Examine the cutting tool for\ndamage.\n\nTest the axis that generates the alarm. Write a program in MDI to move the axis. If any movement at any feed\nrate causes the alarm, then the servo amplifier is at fault.\n\n# Low Voltage Inspection\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/servo-amplifier---troubleshooting-guide.html 4/6\n\n\n![](photo/Servo Amplifier - Troubleshooting Guide - CHC.pdf/Servo-Amplifier---Troubleshooting-Guide---CHC.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",
