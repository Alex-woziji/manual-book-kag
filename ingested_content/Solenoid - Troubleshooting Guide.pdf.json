Make sure the shut off valve is\ncompletely open. Many solenoids will not shift correctly without correct air pressure and back\npressure. Test the solenoid in the system. Do not expect the solenoid to operate correctly if the outlets\nare not connected to the system.\nTurrets on ST model lathes, TRPs, and Side-Mount Tool Changer Pockets have specific troubleshooting\nsteps. Refer to the following troubleshooting guides for more information:\n\n[TOOL RELEASE PISTON - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/tool-release-piston--trp----troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[SIDE MOUNT (SMTC) - VF/VM/UMC/EC - CAROUSEL AND POCKET - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/side-mount-tool-changer---carousel-and-pocket---troubleshooting-.html)\n[TSC-300/1K - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/tsc-300-1k---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\nIf you command the solenoid to open or close without the correct air pressure, the solenoid can go into\nan intermediate state that may not correct itself when the machine has correct air pressure.

    "2": "the solenoid out of the intermediate state, close the air valve and power off the machine.\n\n###  Note: Do not use the machine before the air supply to the machine is correct.\n\nA clogged exaust muffler can prevent the solenoid to operate correctly. Remove the exaust muflers\nfrom the solenoid and test the solenoid again.\nTurn on the machine and use the control to activate the solenoid. You can write a simple program\nin MDI mode to command the electrical output to the solenoid.\nGo to the I/O tab on the diagnostics screen on the control. Make sure the state of the ouput changes\nwhen it is commanded. If the state does not change, troubleshoot and fix the problem before you\ncontinue.\nListen for a clicking or buzzing noise from the coil area of the solenoid. The coil area of the solenoid is\nthe black plastic area on most solenoids. You can also feel the clicking if you place your finger on the\nsolenoid. If there is not a clicking sound when the solenoid is commanded, make sure the solenoid\nvalve is connected correctly and that the electrical supply is correct. Inspect the solenoid cables to\nmake sure they are not damaged. Make sure the solenoid receives the correct voltage. The measured\nvoltage must be 120 VAC.\n\n###  Note: Use a voltage detector or a multimeter with needle-tipped probes to measure the voltage.\n\nAlways measure the voltage from the back of the connector. Always measure the voltage with the\nsolenoid connected.\n\nIf the solenoid still does not operate correctly, disconnect the solenoid from the machine and connect it\nto a known electrical source. If the solenoid operates correctly, the machine has an electrical problem.\nDo not replace the solenoid. If the solenoid receives the correct voltage and does not operate correctly,\ncheck the solenoid coil for continuity. If there is no continuity, replace the solenoid. If the coil has\ncontinuity, go to the correct section for your solenoid.\nIf there is coolant leaking from any solenoid, the problem is the TSC check valve in the spindle head.\n\nMany symptoms can be caused by contamination or debris in the solenoid. If the solenoid leaks after you\ntested it for correct air and power, manually activate it with a 2 mm allen key. Cycle the valve to release any\ncontamiation or debris that may have been stuck in the valve. If the solenoid still does not operate correctly,\nremove the solenoid and inspect the ports for contamination or debris. Clean the solenoid with compressed\nair while cycling it. Some solenoids (i.e. Asco) have the capability to be disassembled in the field. See\nthe Cleaning ASCO, SMC or FESTO Brand Solenoids section in this document. Replace the solenoid if the\nports are covered in contamination or debris that cannot be removed.\n\n# 2-PORT SOLENOIDS\n\n\nA: MAC, SMC, and Festo Brand\n\n1. Port 1 is usually the input port.\n2. Port 2 is usually the outlet port.\n3. Port 3 can have a plug to make this a\n\n2-port solenoid. This is the\nconfiguration for some air-purge\nsolenoids.\n\nB: ASCO Brand\n\n1. Port 1 is usually the input port.\n2. Port 2 is usually the outlet port.\n\n\n![](photo/Solenoid - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Solenoid---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/solenoid---troubleshooting-guide.html 3/10\n\n\n-----\n\n",
    "3": "1. When the solenoid is de-energized, the\n\nair flow stops at port 1.\n2. When the solenoid is energized, the air\n\nflows through port 1 and out through\nport 2.\n3. If the power fails, air flow stops. The\n\nsolenoid goes back to its de-energized\nposition.\n\nThe air-purge solenoid is energized on a timed\ncycle. If too much contamination collects\ninside the solenoid, leaks from the outlet port\ncan occur. You can manually energize some\nbrands of solenoids. This has no effect on the\ntime cycle.\n\nASCO or SMC brand 2-Port solenoid valves are\nmost commonly used for the air system\npurge. These solenoids are also used in the\nCoolant Refill and TAB options.\n\n###  Note: MAC 3-Port poppet style solenoid\n\nvalves are also used for the air system purge.\nThere is a plug on port number 3 when MAC\n3-way poppet style solenoid valves are used. If\nthere is a leak from one of the ports on a MAC\n3-Port poppet style solenoid valve, push the\nmanual activation button multiple times to\nclear out any debris in the solenoid. If this\ndoes not work, remove the solenoid and clean\nit with compressed air while cycling the\nsolenoid. If a MAC purge solenoid\nreplacement is necessary, do not substitute a\ndifferent MAC solenoid. Use the approved\nreplacement solenoid.\n\nIf these solenoids leak air when the solenoid is\nnot activated, it is likely that debris holds the\nplunger in an open position. Follow this\nprocedures to clean the 2-Port air purge\nsolenoid valve:\n\n\n![](photo/Solenoid - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Solenoid---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n# Cleaning ASCO, SMC and FESTO Brand Solenoids\n\nASCO air purge solenoid:\n\nRemove the red cap [1].\nPush the solenoid coil assembly [2]\ndown to compress the spring inside.\nRemove the specification plate [3] by\nsliding off.\nRemove the split spring [4] and valve\nsubassembly [5] from the coil assembly\n\n[2].\nDisassemble the valve subassembly\n\n[5].\nClean the parts with compressed air.\nBe sure to remove all debris from\ninside the valve.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/solenoid---troubleshooting-guide.html 4/10\n\n\n![](photo/Solenoid - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Solenoid---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-3-0.png)\n\n-----\n\n",

If there is pressure at port 1, the solenoid is damaged. If\nthere is a blast of air from the output port number 2, debris was removed from the valve by repeated\nmanual activation, or there is an electrical problem with the machine or the solenoid.
