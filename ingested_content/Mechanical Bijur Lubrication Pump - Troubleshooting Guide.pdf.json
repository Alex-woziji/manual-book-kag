Power cable: Supplies power to the\n\nlube pump.\n2. Oil pressure gauge: Shows the oil\n\npressure.\n3. Oil pump motor and\n\ngearbox: Pumps the oil from the\nreservoir.\n4. Oil filter: Removes contamination\n\nfrom the oil. Some machines have an\nexternal filter next to the oil reservoir.\n5. Oil reservoir: Stores the oil.\n6. Low-level switch: Shows if the oil\n\nlevel is low. This activates Alarm 121\nLOW OIL LEVEL OR PRESSURE.\n7. Pressure switch: (behind pump)\n\nShows if the pressure is low.\n\nSome symptoms are resolved by regular\n[maintenance. Refer to BIJUR - MECHANICAL -](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/bijur---mechanical---oil-pump---service-and-test.html)\n[OIL PUMP - SERVICE AND TEST for detailed](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/how-to/bijur---mechanical---oil-pump---service-and-test.html)\ninformation on how to perform proper\nmaintenance on your oil pump.\n\n|mptom Table|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|SYMPTOM|POSSIBLE CAUSE|CORRECTIVE ACTION|\n|Alarm 121 LOW OIL LEVEL OR PRESSURE|Oil level is low.|Add oil.|\n||The pressure switch is faulty.|Replace the pressure switch.|\n||There is no voltage going to the pump, or the pump is damaged.|Check the voltage to the pump and I/O PCB.|\n||The filter is clogged.|Remove the sintered Bronze filter.|\n|The pump does not hold pressure.|There is a leak from the fittings.|Stop fittings from leaking.

    "2": "Corrective Action:\n\nCheck the pressure switch for correct\noperation. The switch is located behind the\nlube pump assembly. Use a multi meter set to\nOhms to measure the resistance between\nboth leads on the switch. The plunger\nactivates approximately every (30) minutes.\n\nWhen the plunger is NOT activated, the\nreading on the multi meter should be very\nhigh or \"O.L.\" Once you manually activate the\nplunger, you will see 1 Ohm. If the switch\n[operates correctly, go to I/O PCB -](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (CLASSIC HAAS](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n[CONTROL) to troubleshoot the I/O PCB.](https://www.haascnc.com/content/haascnc/en/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/classic-haas-control---i-o-pcb---troubleshooting-guide.html)\n\n\n![](photo/Mechanical Bijur Lubrication Pump - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Mechanical-Bijur-Lubrication-Pump---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\n# Voltage\n\n Filter\n\n Oil Leak\n\nCorrective Action:\n\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nCommand the spindle to operate at 5 rpm.\nMeasure the voltage to the lube pump motor.\n\nUse a multi meter set to VAC. If the voltage is\n120 VAC, but there is no movement, replace\nthe pump.\n\nExamine the worm screw inside the tank. If\nthe lube pump is receiving voltage, the screw\nrotates slowly at 1 rpm.\n\n\n![](photo/Mechanical Bijur Lubrication Pump - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Mechanical-Bijur-Lubrication-Pump---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-1.png)\n\nSymptom: The pump does not hold pressure.\n\nPossible Cause: The filter is clogged.\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nRemove the oil tank, Clean any sludge or\ndebris.\n\nRemove and discard the sintered bronze filter.\n\nReassemble the unit without the filter.\n\nReinstall the tank and fill with synthetic oil.\n\n\n![](photo/Mechanical Bijur Lubrication Pump - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf/Mechanical-Bijur-Lubrication-Pump---Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf-2-0.png)\n\nTest the system for leaks by manually lifting the plunger. The gauge will show pressure and gradually drop to\nzero. This takes 3-10 minutes. If pressure drops immediately, check for leaks at the lube pump. Examine all\naxis linear guide trucks and ballscrews for signs of lubrication. Examine each of the flow meters, lube fittings,\nand connectors.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/mechanical_bijur_lube_pump_TSG.html 3/4\n\n\n-----\n\n",
    "3": "Look for drips of oil near the axis flow meters, tees, and connectors.\n\nCheck for leaks in the system. Start with the fittings located at the lube pump assembly. Repair the leaks.\n\nRepair all leaks. Make sure the pressure is correct.\n\n# Flow Meters\n\nCorrective Action:\n\nClogged orifices are the only cause of high pressure for more than 10 minutes. Remove the cause of the\nclogged oil lines or meter units.\n\nhttps://www.haascnc.com/service/troubleshooting-and-how-to/troubleshooting/mechanical_bijur_lube_pump_TSG.html 4/4\n\n\n-----\n\n"
